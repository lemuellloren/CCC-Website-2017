    Vitamin B is more often referred to today as the B vitamins to better relate that it is actually a group of 8 different vitamins, with varying functions and sources. B vitamins, like vitamin C, are water soluble, which means that extra levels of B vitamins are excreted by the body, though small amounts are stored in the liver and toxicity, while rare, is possible.
    
    Most people will recognize many of the B vitamins by name. They include thiamine, riboflavin, and niacin (B1, 2, and 3, respectively), as well as folic acid (B9). The other four B vitamins are less commonly referred to and are: pyridoxine (B6), cyanocobalamin (B12), pantothenic acid, and biotin.

    If you haven’t found relief for migraine, you’re not alone. About 28 million people suffer from the severe, throbbing pain of migraine, which can last from hours to days, keeping sufferers from family, work and daily life. Yet, two-thirds of patients say they are less than satisfied with their current treatment, according to a survey of 3,064 migraine sufferers conducted by Pfizer. Sufferers may often feel discouraged and unmotivated to discuss the pain and impact with others, even their doctors. To help sufferers overcome barriers that can prevent them from seeking effective pain relief, life coach and migraine sufferer Rhonda Britten is speaking out as part of a new education campaign sponsored by Pfizer.

  services_name: Liposuction
  services_content: |
    As we’ve specified already, liposuction is a fairly easy procedure. The basic apparatus involves a cannula which is used to penetrate the skin and suck out the fat and a suction or vacuum mechanism that helps pull the fat out from the desired area. The areas are targeted and sometimes technologies like ultra-sound or water or laser are used to melt the fat in areas to make it easier to extract. Some of these technologies have been known to benefit patients over time while others have risks associated with them but at the end of the day, it is up to the patient and doctor to find out what will work best on a case-by-case basis. The effects of liposuction, before and after treatment, are quite diametrically different. Usually, after treatment, there is some scarring and change in the colour of skin but this is natural since the procedure directly affects the upper areas of the body. In all, though, it is beneficial, especially if the person undertaking the treatment is opting for body sculpting treatment or body sculpting surgery since this can be maintained over a long period of time with minimal efforts from the patient.
    
    
    Liposuction is an easy solution which removes excessive fat from certain areas of the body. The procedure is a cosmetic solution to the problem of excess fat that accumulates in certain areas of the body and can be conducted with a lot of ease. The simple liposuction surgery involves the insertion of a tube that pulls out excess fat from the desired area and allows the surgeon to shape the body as desired. This is why liposuction treatments are often also used as solutions which allow for body sculpting treatment. Liposuction body sculpting is a great way for people who are looking to tone up to get their desired shape and then maintain it using regular exercise.

    Liposuction treatment or liposuction surgery is one of the most common procedures in the USA. This is testament to the fact that liposuction procedure is a relatively safe one. Fat removal treatment is not complicated but there are problems that can arise from person-to-person depending on the recipient’s health and well-being. This means that a thorough check-up and disclosure of any issues is recommended. In an occasional scenario, there might be allergies that can cause problems and complications. Around one in ten thousand cases can lead to complications which might cause death but in most cases this is avoided and will only happen if the surgeon is entirely inexperienced or conducting treatments using illegal methods. There is a possibility that liposuction might leave a patient with scarring that cannot be cured or taken care of. Another issue with liposuction can be the very real and possible result of embolisms and pulmonary issues which can lead to more complications like necrosis of the skin and even possible amputation. While these side-effects are very real, liposuction risks and side-effects are relatively uncommon and very rarely arise when the procedure is performed by skilled practitioners who have ample experience.
