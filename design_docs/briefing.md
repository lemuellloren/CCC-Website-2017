# Carlingford Chiropractic Centre Website

## Briefing

Client: Carlingford Chiropractic Centre
Contact: Tim Wade-Ferrell - Chiropractor

The main purpose of the site is to get existing and prospective patients to directly book appointments on the site itself. Tim uses an online practice management system, [Cliniko](http://cliniko.com) which can provide us with an embeddable booking form - i.e., visitors will click a call-to-action button and the Cliniko booking form will appear in a modal window. 

The online booking system that Cliniko offers is quite limited, only allowing the visitor to pick a certain number of available times. Tim, therefore, would like the booking modal to be able to also display a message and a ‘contact us’ button, in case none of the displayed times suit the visitor.

Tim has been in practice for over 30 years, and is a specialist in the [Activator](https://www.activator.com) instrument method. His client base consist equally of elderly patients and younger families. Tim likes ‘clean’ websites (lots of negative space). The practice has a logo, and they have a preference for darker tones - which are more soothing for the patients who are in pain. Tim doesn’t want anything in *green*. His business cards are dark red, the clinic is decorated in dark blue and dark yellow (mustard) tones, and his invoices are black and white.

It was recommended that his site should have a Home Page, and a Blog section.

HOME PAGE
- Hero Banner: with prominent “book an appointment” call-to-action, business name & logo, heading (on a slideshow) with a(n unobtrusive) background picture (also on a slideshow).
- Promo Section: with picture and text, promoting monthly events or marketing pushes from the clinic - featuring a ‘book appointment’ call-to-action button.
- What We Treat: a section showing a clickable diagram of the human body (front and back), with parts that highlight as the visitor hovers over, and once clicked, open into a modal that explains the problems of the body part that are treated. The section should have some intro text, and a call-to-action button. Each modal will have at least 1 main picture, and also a call-to-action btn to trigger booking.
- Types of Treatment: optional section divided into 2 or 3 panes, talking about the different types of treatment available - Chiropractic, Massage, Laser (with call-to-action btn to trigger booking).
- About Us: section with photos of the staff and brief description - 2 call-to-action btns: ‘call us’ and ‘book an appointment’.
- Contact Section: phone number, google map, address, contact form, info text and prominent ‘book now’ call-to-action
- Blog Callout: section with a scrollable gallery of the last 4-5 blog posts, enticing visitors to read more.
- Partners: gallery of scrolling, clickable logos of partners
- Footer: links to legal documents, copyright notice, social media share buttons, footer text. Should also have ‘book an appointment’ call-to-action button.

Site will also contain a BLOG SECTION - i.e., Blog page, Article Page, Search Results page. 

ARTICLES can be either text-based, or video articles. Articles should include *optional* comments.

Blog/Article/Search pages will also include Contact Section, Partners and Footer.

SITE NAVIGATION
Site navigation should be fixed on-screen, and should contain:
* “book appointment now” call-to-action button
* “call now” button
* location map button
* social media share buttons
* back-to-top button
